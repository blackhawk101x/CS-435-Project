# CS-435-Project
This project was done under the New Jersey Institute of Technology Computer as a semester long project. A perfect score was recieved.

## Overview
This was a simple project created by the NJIT Computer Science course CS 435 to impove our understanding of certain algorithms and usage
of the linked list data structures. The goal was to create a series of function wwhich could calaculate a long integer of near indefinite
length. We needed to be able to convert both a string on numbers and an integer into our data structure. From there, we had to be able to
take a series of these huge numbers and add, subtract, multiple, and raise to them to the power of one another. Python was used to verify
the output. 

### Data Structure - Double Linked list
A double linked list was used to aid in calculating the numbers 
### Add Long Integer

### Substract Long Integer

### Multiply Long Integer

### Power Long Integer
This is the text book situation where recursion is the best solution where the function called itself and the Multiply function to produce
the output. 
## My Reflection
This was a painfully easy assignment. It by no means improved my programming skills, in all honesty I think I may have hurt my skills a
little. I see what the professor was trying to do however this assignement should really be given to lower level class like a 200 lvl, not
a 400 lvl class. I would like to see professors give out assignments that did not insist on re-inventing the wheel.
